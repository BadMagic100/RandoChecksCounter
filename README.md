# RandoChecksCounter

A Hollow Knight mod that provides a live counter of locations checked/previewed. In particular, this is
a decent gauge of progress during streamed races.

## FAQ

### What counts as a check?

A location is counted as a check when you preview the location, or when you obtain any item at the location.
Each location is counted no more than once.

### Does this work with Archipelago?

This mod should work with any ItemChanger-based game mode, including Archipelago.

### If it works with mods other than Rando why is it called RandoChecksCounter

Because I'm not very smart and didn't realize that I didn't need a hard dependency on rando. And also
because I can't be bothered to rename the project.
